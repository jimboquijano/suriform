# FAQ

Suriform has just been released 🎉 — and while we don’t have a full FAQ yet, this page will soon cover **common questions** and **troubleshooting tips** based on real user feedback.

For now, most information can be found throughout the docs — especially in **Getting Started**, **Core Concepts**, **Tools API**, and **Rule Reference**.

## 📘 About This Page

We’re keeping this FAQ intentionally minimal at launch. As developers begin using Suriform, we’ll collect the most helpful questions from GitHub issues, community discussions, and real-world use cases — then expand this page to make it more useful.

You can help shape it by sharing your experience or opening a discussion in [Github](https://github.com/jimboquijano/suriform).

## 💡 Quick Pointers

Here’s a quick overview of what Suriform offers out of the box:

- 🧠 **Custom Rules** – Write complex async rules with dynamic messages
- ⚡ **Built-in Rules** – Use over 50 built-in rules with native support
- 💬 **Messaging** – Manage messages across rule, locale, and group levels
- 🌍 **Localization** – Granular locale control — globally and per form
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** – Inline, popup, and summary error feedbacks
- 🧩 **Events & Hooks** – Extend behavior through validation lifecycle hooks
- 👁️ **Watchers** – Reactively observe and respond to form or field changes
